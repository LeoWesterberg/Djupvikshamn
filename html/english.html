                <h2>Port of Djupvik</h2>
                <img src="../resurser/Djupvik%20bilder/D-21.jpg" style=width:45% alt="A picture of a roof top and tree tops with beautiful island in the horizon" />
                
                <p>
                    The Port of Djupvik is located on the east coast of Gotland very close to the beautiful smaller island Lilla Karlsö. 
                    Adjacent to the port is a small and charming fishing-village which, during summer, comes to life with a relaxed and 
                    welcoming buzz.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Close by and situated with a fantastic view over the port is Djupvik Hotel, with modern standard and with its own popular restaurant.  
                </p>

                <p>
                    Both the port and the fishing village have a beautiful view of two popular bird islands called “Lilla Karlsö” and “Stora Karlsö”.
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    The coastline south of Djupvik, called “Ekstakusten” is incredibly beautiful and invites to nice scenery and views on foot, by bike or by car.
                </p>
                <p>
                    North, and connected to the port, is a small sandy beach which is well soothed for a nice swim.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The distance from the port to Lilla Karlsö is about 2 nautical miles and it is about twice as long to Stora Karlsö (4nm).
